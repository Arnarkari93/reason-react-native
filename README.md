## üö® Usage from Git repo

If you use things unreleased from the git repo, you will need to link all
folders (packages) that you need at the root of node_modules. The easiest way is
to create the symlink you need in your `package.json` `prepare` step:

First add this repo as a dep

```console
yarn add https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-react-native
```

Next, add this cross-platform symlink tool

```console
yarn add --dev symlink-dir
```

Then add to you `package.json`

```js
{
  "scripts": {
    "reason-react-native-monorepo-trick": "symlink-dir ./node_modules/reason-react-native-monorepo/reason-react-native node_modules/reason-react-native && symlink-dir ./node_modules/reason-react-native-monorepo/bs-react-native-jsx3-compat node_modules/bs-react-native-jsx3-compat",
    "prepare": "yarn reason-react-native-monorepo-trick"
  }
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è In the example above, we only linked `reason-react-native` and
`bs-react-native-jsx3-compat`. Be sure to link all the package you have in your
`bsconfig.json` that need to be used from git.

üëÄ If you find a trick more easy to read/maintain (and still cross-platform),
please share it with us via Discord, an issue, or a PR!
